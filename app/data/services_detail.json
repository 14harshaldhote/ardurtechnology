The major steps involved within this use case were the identification of various sensors that correlated well with the effectiveness of engine water wash and subsequently training a Random Forest algorithm on the identified feature set. The model triggered an alarm to highlight cases with low effectiveness probability immediately after an engine water wash. The solution was implemented for 3-4 families of engines and resulted in savings worth $70M."
