The trained predictive model detects early degradation signals by analyzing multi-dimensional sensor patterns including EGT margins, vibration signatures, fuel flow deviations, and oil consumption trends. The system raises prioritized alerts for high-severity anomalies requiring immediate attention, enabling preventative maintenance action before in-flight shutdowns or forced removals occur. This ML-based predictive maintenance solution delivered $27M in quantified savings from avoided unscheduled engine shop visits, reduced warranty claims, and optimized maintenance planning."
