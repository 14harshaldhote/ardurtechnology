        "text": "Being a part of mortgage industry, you might be well aware of heavy paperwork involved all the processes. This data is sensitive in nature and needs to be arranged properly before the loan is funded by lenders. For lenders, it's a challenging task to deal with this sensitive data stored in disorganized formats, files, and locations. If not handled efficiently, it may lead to errors, discrepancies, and data corruption, which in turn, makes the whole situation worse. Document stacking and indexing is the ideal solution to manage all these challenges. Document stacking is referred to the order in which loan documents, submitted by the applicant, are stored in a legal-sized folder. Documents were stored in a specific sequence, making it easier for the loan processor to search for a document in case if he required to refer to a document. With the advent of computers, though digitization has taken place the sequence or 'stacking' remains the same."

Last year, global revenues for airlines reached almost three quarters of a trillion dollars. With approximately 77 flights taking off every minute of the day (24/7), imagine the amount of data these flights might be generating.
